			<br>My chess journey began when I was 7 years old. 
			<br>My mother has enrolled me into a chess class, in a series of many other classes, 
			<br>hoping that I would show some kind of talent in one of these activities. 
			<br>I didn't pay attention to almost anything in class. Most of it was going over my head anyway.
			<br>Three lessons in, I simply left the classroom, returning home and worrying everyone. Needless to say, I never went there again
				Still, I carried on playing, and have played chess since, very slowly getting better.
			<br>My breakthrough in chess came when I first joined ChessSoc in the University of Sheffield. 
				When I saw how how much better than me some students were, and we also started playing with teams from outside our club, I was inspired and motivated to get so much better. I have since developed into my current play style, mainly aggressive and sharp, but without foregoing accuracy.
		<br><br>Chess has posed a great challenge for me - balancing effort, accuracy and timeliness. In essence, I see chess games serving as microcosms of real world project work. 
				I have a natural tendency towards taking my time on problems so that I come up with a solution that I am satisfied with. 
				This means I often get lost in the details, spending an disproportional amount of time on them. 
				The strict time format in Chess does not allow for this. It serves to remond me that I sometimes need to simply get on with my work making rela progress, as it's not worth risking the usefulness of my work, or even my integrity, for the sake of fulfilling my vision of what my work should look like.
		<br><br>These days, I am still playing chess online and with the University of Sheffield Chess Society. I can hold my own against most people. <a href="https://lichess.org/aOdfsZxr">Challenge me if you dare.</a>
