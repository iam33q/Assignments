        <h1>Github</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Github is an extremely popular code repository and version control tool. It enables developers around the world to communicate and work more efficiently on their software product.
        <br>Github repositories can be shared and synchronised through an IDE such as VSCode, and offer great control over file addition and editing - as part of the workflow in the product development.
        <br>Each repository has a number of versions of the product, called "branches". The main body of files is called the Main (or "Master") branch.  
        <br>Developers can contribute with updates on the product by creating "forks", which deviate from and exist in parallel to the master branch.
        <br>The act of applying an edit to the code within a repository called a "commit" action. This can be either adding or editing files within a repository.</p>
        <br>The act of merging a particular forked version of code to the master branch is an important step in the workflow. Through the submission of a "Pull request", the new code is shared with the rest of the development team. 
        <br>Once the team has ensured that the code is compatible with the main branch, it can be merged with the main branch
        <p> Some basic commands include: 

            <br>git init 
            <br>This will create a new local GIT repository.
            <br>git clone 
            <br>This is used to copy a repository. 
            <br>git add 
            <br>This is used to add files to the staging area.
            <br>git commit 
            <br>This will create a snapshot of the changes and save it to the git directory
