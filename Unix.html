        <br>
        <p>The Unix shell is a CLI and scripting language, used mainly for managing files and automating basic tasks. </p>
        <br>
        <p> Basic commands include: 
            ls - Displays current directory. 
        In combination with flags (appendages to the command), this can be used to display a variety of additional information and formats:
            ls -a : Displays all files
            ls -F : Additionally displays file names.
            ls -r : Displays directory in reverse order.
            
            cd    : Changes the directory to selected directory.
            mkdir : Creates new directory inside the working directory:
            rm    : Removes named files and folders
        </p>
